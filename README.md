🎹 Toy Piano - Module Project IIIWelcome to the Toy Piano project repository!This project was developed by Group 15 for the Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering at Sivas Science and Technology University.Our goal was to design and implement a simple yet functional "Toy Piano" capable of generating distinct musical tones using analog circuitry and signal processing concepts.👥 Project Team (Group 15)NameIDRoleKaan Özkan230202073Circuit Theory, Design, Proteus SimulationErkut Doğan240201044Electronics Design, Circuit SetupFurkan Hatipoğulları220202015Signals & Systems, MATLAB Analysis, ReportingAdvisor: Dr. Ass. Sıtkı AkkayaDate: 26.12.2025📖 Project OverviewIn this project, we designed a circuit to generate musical notes (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do) within one octave. The core of the system is a 555 Timer IC configured in Astable Multivibrator mode.Key Features:Tone Generation: Square-wave signal generation using a 555 Timer.Frequency Control: A resistor ladder network controlled by push buttons to change the oscillation frequency (musical notes).Amplification: A Class B Push-Pull (Complementary Symmetry) amplifier (using TIP31/TIP32 transistors) to drive the speaker.Simulation: Validated using Proteus (for circuit logic) and MATLAB (for signal analysis).🛠️ Circuit Design & Theory1. The Oscillator (555 Timer)We used the standard astable frequency formula: $$f = \frac{1.44}{(R_1 + 2R_2) \cdot C}$$C: 100nF (constant)R1: 1kΩ (constant)R2: Variable resistance determined by the button pressed.2. Frequency Table & Error RatesWe calculated the theoretical values vs. the measured values. Here is a summary of our results:ButtonNoteTheoretical Freq (Hz)Measured Freq (Hz)Error (%)1Fa 5698685.71.83%2Mi 5659644.02.31%3Re 5587571.02.78%4Do 5523511.02.34%5La 4440444.00.91%6G# 4415419.00.89%7F# 4370369.00.27%8Mi 4330328.00.49%3. AmplificationSince the 555 timer cannot drive an 8Ω speaker directly with high quality, we implemented a Push-Pull Amplifier stage to act as a current buffer, ensuring the speaker operates safely.💻 SimulationsMATLAB AnalysisWe modeled the discrete-time signal and compared the oscilloscope measurements with theoretical waves.You can run the analysis using the file: toy_piano_analysis.mProteus CircuitThe circuit schematic includes:Button array for note selection.Resistor ladder.555 Timer IC.Push-pull amplifier stage.Speaker (modeled as RL load).(Screenshots of the simulations can be found in the docs/ folder or the project report).🚀 How to RunMATLAB: Open toy_piano_analysis.m in MATLAB and run it to see the waveform plots and frequency calculations.Proteus: Load the .pdsprj file (if available) to simulate the live circuit.Real Life: Assemble the circuit on a breadboard using the component values listed in the report.📄 License & DisclaimerThis project is for educational purposes as part of the Module Project III course.All rights reserved by Group 15 and Sivas Science and Technology University.# Toy-Piano-
